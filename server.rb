In production, the CLIENT_ID & CLIENT_SECRET (below) should never be
hard-coded or exposed. Instead, you should export environment
variables for these values. NEVER check your CLIENT_ID or CLIENT_SECRET
into a git repository that is or may become public.

In production, these values should be accessed as environement variables
like this: CLIENT_ID = ENV['CLIENT_ID']

CLIENT_ID = ENV['CLIENT_ID']
CLIENT_SECRET = ENV['CLIENT_SECRET']
