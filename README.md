## üß≠ About The Project

This is the final project in the Ruby module to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ 'The Global School for Remote Software Developers!'). However, as this is the Capstone project for the section, some special rules apply.
 - The project is entirely solo
 - A 72 hour deadline is issued upon receipt of the project specifications
 
The purpose of these specifications is to mimic real world deadlines and job specifications.

## ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What Is It?
Gitshoes is a native desktop tool for using Github. At it's very core, Gitshoes is coded in Ruby, using the [Shoes3]('https://github.com/shoes/shoes3') GUI library and Github's very own API. The Shoes3 GUI library is written in C and then compiled into Ruby, however when it comes to the use of Shoes in this project, all code was written in Ruby. Current (v0.1) functionality available to those using Gitshoes are as follows:
  - Search Github
  - Recieve randomised, daily quotes on the start-up screen
  - An information screen informing the user about the program
  - A login screen which launches an OAuth request for the users Github credentials in browser.

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è Why Is It?
It goes without saying that Github is an integral part of all of our lives as developers - there's not a day that goes by where we are working on a project and aren't making frequent commits, searching Github's code database, creating new repositories, reviewing pull requests...the list goes on.

For those of us who like to always have a Github page open in our browser, alongside ~100 other tabs, it can often get a little confusing or vague as to exactly where, amongst those 100 tabs you placed Github. That's where Gitshoes comes in.

As a native application, Gitshoes seperates itself from your browser, making it easier to compartmentalise your Github expetrience (so to speak).

## üö¶ Current State & Limitations
As of Gitshoes v0.1, there are a number of functions that have been implemented, however there is a longer list of function to **yet** be implemented. As this is a work in progress, the following fucntionality is planned for release at a future date:
 - Import and view all of your dashboard, profile, existing repository, pull request and issue data and view that data inside Gitshoes.
 - Implement an in-app search function versus redirecting to the broswer
 - Greater cross-platform compatiblity between 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
